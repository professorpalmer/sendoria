## Quick Setup

### 3. Set Up Discord Bot
- Create a bot at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- **Enable Message Content Intent**: Sidebar → Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents → Toggle ON "Message Content Intent"
- Make sure the bot is set to "Public Bot" in the Bot tab! *This will still only allow it to be in servers you invite it to.*
- Copy the bot token to `sendoria_config.txt`
- **Invite bot to your server**: Sidebar → OAuth2 → URL Generator → Select "bot" which will enable a drop down menu → Drop down menu → Select permissions: 
    - "Send Messages"
    - "Read Message History"
    - "Manage Messages"
    - "Add Reactions"

**Scroll down to "generated URL" → Copy URL and open it in a web browser. Invite the bot to your created server.**

### 4. Configure Channels (sendoria_config.txt)
- Enable Developer Options: Discord Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode
- Right-click each channel → Copy ID
- Add channel IDs to config file

### 5. Run the Bot
- Double-click `SendoriaBot.exe` (accept the Windows security warning)
- Keep it running for as long as you want to use the relay

### 6. Enable Relay in FFXI
Run these commands to start relaying:
- `//lua l sendoria` - Load the addon
- `//send relay on` - Enable relay mode
- `//send tell on` - Enable tell relay
- `//send outgoing on` - Show your character's own sent messages (optional)
- `//send party on` - Enable party relay (optional)
- `//send ls1 on` - Enable linkshell relay (optional)

## How to Use

**FFXI → Discord**: Just chat normally in game  
**Discord → FFXI**: Type in Discord channels  
**Tells**: `/tell PlayerName message` in Discord

## FFXI Commands
- `//send help` - Show commands
- `//send party on` - Enable party chat relay
